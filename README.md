# Planar Maps Library for SageMath

This project is a SageMath library for working with planar maps. Planar maps are embeddings of graphs on surfaces, often used in graph theory, combinatorics, and topology. This library provides tools for creating, visualizing, and manipulating planar maps within the SageMath environment.

# Documentation 

The implementation of the Planar Maps is mostly based on the following documentation :

- [1] : An introduction to map enumeration, Guillaume Chapuy, 2014 [https://www.irif.fr/~chapuy/AEC/coursHagenberg.pdf]

- [2] : Handbook on Enumerative Combinatorics, Gilles Schaeffer, Chapter 5, 2015

# Features

- PlanarMap class, to represent a planar map. Can be built from permutations sigma and alpha (see [1]), or an adjacency list.

- Visualization: Plot planar maps

- Analysis Tools:

- Compute face counts, number of nodes, edges, genus, diameter 

- Spanning Tree, Dual graph Derived Map, Incidence Map construction.
