# Planar Maps Library for SageMath

This project is a SageMath library for working with planar maps. Planar maps are embeddings of graphs on surfaces, often used in graph theory, combinatorics, and topology. This library provides tools for creating, visualizing, and manipulating planar maps within the SageMath environment.

# Features

- Graph Embedding: Embed graphs in the plane or on other surfaces.

- Map Generation: Generate random planar maps and classical planar graphs.

- Visualization: Plot planar maps with various customization options.

- Analysis Tools:

- Compute face counts, vertex degrees, and edge configurations.

- Verify planarity of graphs.

- Dual graph construction.

- Export/Import: Export planar maps to common formats (e.g., GraphML, adjacency lists) or import existing maps.

# Prerequisites

SageMath: Version 9.0 or higher. Download from SageMath.org.

Python: The library is written in Python and works seamlessly with SageMath's Python interpreter.
